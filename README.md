# CS-305
Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?
What did you do particularly well in identifying their software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a companyâ€™s overall wellbeing?
What about the process of working through the vulnerability assessment did you find challenging or helpful?
How did you approach the need to increase layers of security? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to assess vulnerabilities and determine mitigation techniques?
How did you ensure the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
What resources, tools, or coding practices did you employ that you might find helpful in future assignments or tasks?
Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to demonstrate your skills, knowledge, and experience. What from this particular assignment might you want to showcase to a future employer?

1. Artemis financial is a finance management company looking to make their platform secure for users. 
2. I think I did well interpreting the dependency check results and filtering out false positives.
3. I found all of the file names and how to filter out false positives confusing at first, but once I figured out how to do it, it wasn't very difficult.
4. I found the information linked to the dependency check through other websites really helpful, and I found some useful coding forums that helped me learn how to use these well. 
5. I tried to find the best solutions that would make the software more secure, and I found tools that were already at my disposal that I did not know about before to find and fix security vulnerabilities.
6. To ensure the code was functional and secure, I did multiple tests running the code and the dependency check to ensure that the code was functional and not vulnerable. 
7. I found out how to use the websites that describe the vulnerabilites and how to fix them, and I think that will help me a lot the next time I need to find security vulnerabilities.
8. I might want to showcase how I added the encryption algorithm and security certificates to a future employer
